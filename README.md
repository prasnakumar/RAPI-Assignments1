Understanding HTTP and HTTPS

What is HTTP?
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between clients (like web browsers) and servers.

How HTTP Works:
When you enter a website address (e.g., http://example.com) into your browser:

Your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server.

The server processes the request and replies with an HTTP response, which contains content like HTML, text, or images.

Your browser takes this response and renders it as a web page.

Key Characteristics of HTTP:
It’s a communication protocol that defines how browsers and servers interact.

HTTP is stateless, meaning each request is treated as independent — the server doesn’t remember previous requests.

The more secure version of this protocol is HTTPS, which adds encryption for safe data exchange.

What is HTTPS?
HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure variant of HTTP that encrypts the data sent between your browser and the website.

Whenever you visit a website with https:// at the beginning, it means:

The connection is encrypted, protecting the data in transit.

Third parties, like hackers, cannot easily read or alter the information.

 How Does HTTPS Ensure Security?
HTTPS uses SSL/TLS protocols to:

Encrypt the data being exchanged.

Verify that the website is authentic using a digital certificate.

Ensure that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable to attackers.

Benefits of HTTPS:
Keeps user data (like login credentials and credit card details) safe

Prevents unauthorized access or modification of content

Provides visual trust indicators (like the padlock symbol in browsers)

Favored by search engines — it can improve your site’s SEO ranking
