Overview:
HTTP/1.0, introduced in 1996, expanded upon HTTP/0.9 by adding more functionality.
It supported multiple HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT), included headers for additional metadata, and allowed for more flexible communication between clients and servers.
Despite its improvements, it still had limitations, such as no support for persistent connections and lack of more advanced optimizations.

Request and Response Format:
* Request: An HTTP/1.0 request includes the method (GET, POST, etc.), the requested resource, the protocol version (HTTP/1.0), and headers.
* Response: The server response includes a status code, headers, and the content of the requested resource.


Key Features of HTTP/1.0:

* Methods: Supported multiple HTTP methods, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

* Headers: HTTP/1.0 introduced headers, allowing servers and clients to exchange additional information, such as Content-Type, Content-Length, and Host.

* Status Codes: Included HTTP status codes, such as 200 OK and 404 Not Found, to provide more context about the request’s outcome.

* Request Format: Requests contained the method, resource path, protocol version, and headers.

* Response Format: Responses included status codes, headers, and the requested content.


Limitations of HTTP/1.0:
1. No Persistent Connections: Each request required a separate connection, leading to inefficiencies, as a new connection had to be opened for each resource (e.g., for each image or script on a page).

2. No Advanced Caching Mechanisms: HTTP/1.0 provided basic caching with the Cache-Control header, but it didn’t support more advanced features like ETags or conditional requests, which later became important for performance.

3. Limited Performance Optimizations: HTTP/1.0 was still fairly limited in terms of performance optimization for modern websites with multiple assets.

        request.Method = "GET"; // You can also use POST, PUT, etc. in HTTP/1.0
        request.ProtocolVersion = HttpVersion.Version10; // Specify HTTP/1.0

        // Add headers
        request.Headers.Add("Host", "example.com");

        // Send the request and get the response
        HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse();
        
        // Read the response content
        StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream());
        string responseText = reader.ReadToEnd();

        // Display the content
        Console.WriteLine("Response from server:");
        Console.WriteLine(responseText);

        // Close the response and reader
        reader.Close();
        response.Close();
    }
