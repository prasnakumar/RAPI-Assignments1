Overview:
HTTP/0.9 was the first version of the HTTP protocol, created in 1991.
It was very simple and only supported the GET method, allowing clients to retrieve basic HTML pages. 
There were no status codes, headers, or other advanced features.

# Key Features of HTTP/0.9:

1. Method: Only GET was supported for retrieving documents.

2. Versioning: There was no versioning of the protocol (no HTTP/1.1, etc.).

3. Headers: Requests and responses did not include headers.

4. Request Format: The request was simply in the form of GET /path/to/resource.

5. Response Type: Responses contained plain HTML with no metadata (e.g., no status codes or content types).

6. Connection: The connection was closed immediately after the response was sent.

7. Content Support: Only plain HTML was supported, with no support for images, CSS, JavaScript, or other media types.


# Limitations of HTTP/0.9:
1. Only GET Method: HTTP/0.9 only supported the GET method. Other methods like POST, PUT, and DELETE were not supported.

2. No HTTP Headers: There were no headers in the requests or responses, so things like content type, caching, or client capabilities couldn't be specified.

3. Only Plain HTML: The protocol could only fetch plain HTML documents, with no support for other media types like images, CSS, or JavaScript.

4. No Status Codes: The server did not return status codes such as 404 (Not Found) or 200 (OK), so the client had no way to know if the request was successful or failed.

5. No Persistent Connections: Each request required a new connection, leading to inefficiencies and increased latency.

6. No Support for Hostnames: HTTP/0.9 couldn't handle virtual hosting, which was problematic as websites started sharing the same server.

C# code sample of http/0.9

using System;
using System.Net;
using System.IO;

class HttpRequest
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create an HTTP request for a simple HTML page
        string url = "http://example.com/my-page.html";
        
        HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url);
        request.Method = "GET"; // Only GET is supported in HTTP/0.9

        // Send the request and get the response
        HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse();
        
        // Read the response content
        StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream());
        string responseText = reader.ReadToEnd();

        // Display the content
        Console.WriteLine("Response from server:");
        Console.WriteLine(responseText);

        // Close the response and reader
        reader.Close();
        response.Close();
    }
}
